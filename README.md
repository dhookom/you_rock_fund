# You Rock Volatility Income Fund (YRVI)

![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.19.0-blue)

An automated Python algorithmic options trading system that generates weekly income through the complete wheel strategy — selling cash-secured puts (CSPs), managing assignments with covered calls (CCs), and enforcing automatic stop losses — all running 24/7 on a Mac Mini with zero manual intervention.

## How It Works

**Full weekly schedule:**

| Day | Time (PST) | Action |
|-----|-----------|--------|
| Saturday | 6:00 PM | Screener preview — logs top 5 targets, no trades |
| Monday | 9:50 AM | Discord preview — posts this week's sized positions |
| Monday | 9:55 AM | Wheel check — stop losses + sell covered calls on assigned stocks |
| Monday | 10:00 AM | CSP execution — screen → size → execute 5 positions |
| Tuesday–Thursday | 9:00 AM | Daily risk monitor — checks stop loss thresholds, logs P&L |
| Friday | 4:15 PM | Assignment detection — checks for newly assigned positions |

**Pipeline:**

1. **Screener** — fetches candidates from the Render API, applies hard filters (delta ≤ 0.21, buffer ≥ 5%, DTE ≥ 3), and scores survivors by buffer + premium + IV

2. **Position Sizer** — allocates $250K across up to 5 positions (~$50K each, last position gets remainder up to $70K max)

3. **Wheel Manager** — Monday 9:55 AM (four-step logic per holding):
   - **Step 1 — Screener check:** if ticker no longer passes screener filters → sell shares at market and free capital
   - **Step 2 — Option chain:** query IBKR for CALL options on the nearest Friday, strike ≥ assigned strike; collect delta for each candidate
   - **Step 3 — Decision:** sell the highest-delta (≥ 0.20) covered call found. If no strike with delta ≥ 0.20 exists → sell shares at market
   - **Step 4 — Accounting:** freed capital (from any sales) returns to the CSP pool; sold tickers are skipped in that week's screener

4. **Trader** — connects to IBKR, qualifies contracts, checks liquidity (spread ≤ 20%, OI ≥ 100), executes with limit-mid → limit-bid → market escalation; automatically replaces failed positions with the next ranked ticker

5. **Risk Manager** — daily Tue–Thu monitor checks all wheel holdings against the 10% stop loss threshold, logs unrealized P&L, and sends alerts

6. **Discord Poster** — (optional) posts weekly results, YTD stats, Monday previews, and Friday assignment alerts to a Discord channel automatically

## Strategy Overview

### The Wheel Strategy

```
Week 1:  Sell CSP on TICKER at $50 strike → collect $500 premium
           ↓ expires worthless → keep $500, repeat
           ↓ or assigned 100 shares at $50
Week 2:  Sell CC on 100 shares at $50 strike → collect $300 premium
           ↓ expires worthless → keep $300, repeat
           ↓ or shares called away at $50 → back to selling CSPs
```

Each cycle generates income whether the option expires or gets exercised.

### Risk Management

| Control | Rule |
|---------|------|
| Delta filter | Only sell puts with delta ≤ 0.21 (~20Δ) |
| Buffer requirement | Strike must be ≥ 5% below current price |
| Liquidity check | Spread ≤ 20%, Open Interest ≥ 100 |
| Screener exit | Sell shares if ticker drops from screener filters |
| Delta exit | Sell shares if no CC strike with delta ≥ 0.20 available |
| Earnings protection | Skip tickers with earnings within 7 days |
| Auto-replacement | Failed position → automatically try next ranked ticker |

## Getting Started

New to IBKR? See the **[IBKR Account Setup Guide](IBKR_SETUP_GUIDE.md)** for a complete walkthrough — from creating your account to paper trading your first week.

> **You Rock Club members:** If you intend to trade live on IBKR, you will need a Mac Mini (or any always-on Mac). Paper trading can be done on any Mac. Windows is supported for paper trading only.

> 📖 **You Rock Club Mac Mini Setup Guide:** See [MAC_MINI_SETUP.md](./MAC_MINI_SETUP.md) for a complete step-by-step walkthrough from unboxing to first trade.

> ❓ **Troubleshooting:** See [FAQ.md](./FAQ.md) for common setup issues and fixes.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (recommended for Mac) or [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io) (alternative)
- Access to the You Rock Club screener API (Render)

### Hardware Requirements

| Mode | Hardware | OS Required | Secrets Method |
|------|----------|-------------|----------------|
| Paper trading | Any Mac (Intel or Apple Silicon) | macOS | Encrypted secrets container (AES-256-GCM) |
| Live trading | Mac Mini (recommended) | macOS only | Encrypted secrets container (AES-256-GCM) |

> **Cross-platform**: v1.3.0 removed the macOS-only requirement that came with Keychain integration. The stack now runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows. Mac Mini is recommended for live trading purely for the always-on hardware profile and IB Gateway stability — see `setup_windows.ps1` for Windows-specific notes.

### IB Gateway port reference

| Mode | Port (inside Docker network) |
|---|---|
| Paper trading | 4004 |
| Live trading | 4003 |

These are the ports the Python containers use to reach IB Gateway inside the Compose network. They differ from the standalone IB Gateway defaults (4002/4001) used in the legacy launchd setup.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/controllinghand/you_rock_fund.git you_rock_fund
cd you_rock_fund
```

#### Configure `.env.compose`

```bash
cp .env.compose.example .env.compose
```

`.env.compose` only contains non-secret settings (ports, trading mode, timezone) — no editing required for a default paper-trading setup. Leave `TRADING_MODE=paper` and `YRVI_INIT_DRY_RUN=true` for the safe defaults.

#### About Secrets

Account credentials and passwords are stored encrypted (AES-256-GCM) in a persistent volume managed by the `secrets` container. When you run `setup_docker.sh`, it starts the secrets container and opens `http://localhost:8001` in your browser to collect:

**Account Info (required for paper, optional fields for live)**

| Field | What to enter |
|---|---|
| IBKR Paper Account ID | Your IBKR paper account ID (e.g. `DU1234567`) |
| IBKR Paper Username | Your IBKR paper username |
| IBKR Live Account ID | (optional) Your IBKR live account ID — only needed for live trading |
| IBKR Live Username | (optional) Your IBKR live username |
| VNC Password | (optional) defaults to `ibgateway123!test` if not set |

**Passwords & API keys**

- **Required:** IBKR paper password, Render screener API secret
- **Optional:** IBKR live password (only needed for live trading), Discord webhook URL, Discord weekly-plan webhook URL

If the browser flow times out (5 minutes), the script falls back to terminal prompts. You can update any secret later by visiting `http://localhost:8001` directly or via the **Secrets** page in the dashboard.

> **Note:** The `docker/secrets/` directory holds empty placeholder files for the file-based fallback path; it's git-ignored and the real values never live there.

#### Disable macOS Screen Sharing

IB Gateway uses port 5900 for VNC (required for 2FA). macOS Screen Sharing also uses port 5900 and will cause `docker compose up` to fail with a "address already in use" error.

Before running setup, go to **System Settings → General → Sharing → Screen Sharing → toggle OFF**.

> **Note:** Use SSH for remote terminal access to the Mac Mini instead — Screen Sharing cannot run alongside YRVI.

#### macOS Setup (Paper)

```bash
./setup_docker.sh --paper
```

On first run, the script opens `http://localhost:8001` in your browser where you'll enter:
- Your IBKR paper account password
- Your Render screener API secret
- Discord webhooks (optional)
- Your IBKR live password (optional — only needed if you plan to trade live)

If the browser flow times out, you'll be prompted in the terminal. On subsequent runs, the script detects existing secrets and skips this step.

#### macOS Setup (Live)

```bash
./setup_docker.sh --live
```

Requires a Mac Mini or equivalent always-on hardware. Live and paper credentials are stored separately in the secrets container under `tws_password_live` and `tws_password_paper` — they're never shared between modes.

#### Verifying secrets

Open `http://localhost:8001` in your browser, or visit the **Secrets** page in the dashboard at `http://localhost:3000/secrets`. Each secret shows ✅ Configured or ⚠️ Missing.

#### Rotating / updating a secret

To change a stored secret (e.g. after rotating your IBKR password):
1. Open `http://localhost:8001` (or visit **Secrets** in the dashboard)
2. Click **Update** next to the secret
3. Enter the new value and click **Save**

The change takes effect immediately for new connections; restart `ib_gateway` to apply a new IBKR password.

`setup_docker.sh` validates your config, builds all five containers (`secrets`, `ib_gateway`, `api`, `scheduler`, `web`), starts the stack, and installs a login item so containers restart automatically after a reboot. It also registers the `yrvi://` URL scheme so the **Upgrade** button in the dashboard can open Terminal and rebuild automatically.

> **Existing installs (pre-v1.6.0):** If you ran setup before v1.6.0, register the upgrade URL scheme once manually:
> ```bash
> bash scripts/yrvi-register-url-scheme.sh
> ```

See **[CONTAINERIZATION.md](CONTAINERIZATION.md)** for the full setup guide — credentials, 2FA recovery, and troubleshooting.

## Security

### Secret Security

- Secrets are stored AES-256-GCM-encrypted in a persistent Docker volume managed by the `secrets` container. The encryption key is generated on first run and stored at `/data/secrets.key` inside the volume (chmod 600).
- The secrets API (`http://localhost:8001`) is bound to `localhost` on the host and reachable inside the Docker network as `http://secrets:8001` — never exposed externally.
- `docker/secrets/` files are empty placeholders kept for the `secrets_client` 3-tier fallback (HTTP → file → env). The real values live only in the encrypted volume.
- `docker/secrets/` is in `.gitignore` and must never be committed.

### What the Encryption Does and Doesn't Protect

The AES-256-GCM encryption protects against **data-at-rest leaks** — if a volume backup or snapshot were exposed, the credentials inside would be unreadable without the key.

**It does not protect against host-level access.** Because the encryption key lives in the same Docker volume as the encrypted data, anyone who can run `docker exec` on the host — or read the volume files directly — can access both the key and the secrets. The real security perimeter is:

1. **Who can log into the Mac Mini** (physically or via SSH)
2. **The API being localhost-only** — `http://localhost:8001` is never reachable from outside the machine

### If You Go Live (Real Money)

Before switching to a live IBKR account, review these risks:

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Unauthorized SSH access → full secret exposure | Disable password SSH login; use key-based auth only (`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`: `PasswordAuthentication no`) |
| Mac Mini stolen or physically accessed | Enable FileVault full-disk encryption — note this requires entering a password on every reboot (disables auto-login) |
| IBKR API credentials compromised | Use a dedicated IBKR sub-account for the fund with withdrawal restrictions enabled in IBKR Client Portal |
| Runaway trades if system malfunctions | Keep IBKR's built-in daily loss limit set in Client Portal → Settings → Account Settings |

> **Auto-login vs. FileVault:** The default setup uses auto-login for hands-free reboots. FileVault disables auto-login. For live trading, the recommended posture is: enable FileVault, accept that a reboot requires a manual login to restart the stack, and treat that as a feature (no unattended access).

## Mac Startup (after any reboot)

**Double-click `YRVI Startup` on your Desktop** to run the pre-flight check. It verifies the Docker containers are running and prints a full GO/NO-GO status table.

Or from the terminal:
```bash
bash ~/you_rock_fund/startup.sh
```

**Container management:**
```bash
# Status
docker compose --env-file .env.compose ps

# Logs
docker compose --env-file .env.compose logs -f scheduler
docker compose --env-file .env.compose logs -f ib_gateway

# Restart scheduler
docker compose --env-file .env.compose restart scheduler
```

### Restarting and Rebuilding Containers

Both scripts verify the secrets container is reachable and configured before operating. They no longer write secrets to disk — that's handled by the `secrets` container.

| Script | When to use |
|--------|-------------|
| `yrvi-restart.sh` | Restart existing container — same image, no rebuild (fast) |
| `yrvi-build.sh` | Rebuild image then restart — use after code changes |

**yrvi-restart.sh** — restart without rebuilding:
```bash
./scripts/yrvi-restart.sh ib_gateway --paper
./scripts/yrvi-restart.sh api        --paper
./scripts/yrvi-restart.sh scheduler  --paper
./scripts/yrvi-restart.sh ib_gateway --live   # requires YRVI_ENV=live in environment
```

Flags: `--dry-run`

**yrvi-build.sh** — rebuild image and restart:
```bash
./scripts/yrvi-build.sh api       --paper   # after editing api.py
./scripts/yrvi-build.sh scheduler --paper   # after editing scheduler.py
./scripts/yrvi-build.sh all       --paper   # rebuild full stack
```

Flags: `--dry-run`

**What both scripts do:**
1. Verify the `secrets` container is reachable at `http://localhost:8001` (fail with a helpful message if not)
2. Verify all required secrets are configured (fail with a link to enter them if not)
3. `yrvi-restart.sh`: runs `docker restart <container>` — `yrvi-build.sh`: runs `docker compose up -d --build [container]`
4. Poll health status every 3s (`ib_gateway` timeout: 180s; others: 60s)

## Running Manually

**Run full pipeline once immediately** (screener → size → execute):
```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.compose exec scheduler python - <<'PY'
import scheduler
scheduler.run_pipeline()
PY
```

**Manual wheel operations:**
```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.compose exec scheduler python wheel_manager.py detect
docker compose --env-file .env.compose exec scheduler python wheel_manager.py check
docker compose --env-file .env.compose exec scheduler python risk_manager.py
```

**Dry run** — set `dry_run: true` via the dashboard settings or the API:
```bash
curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/settings \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"dry_run":true}'
```

## Monitoring

**Live container logs:**
```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.compose logs -f scheduler   # execution, wheel, risk jobs
docker compose --env-file .env.compose logs -f api         # dashboard API requests
docker compose --env-file .env.compose logs -f ib_gateway  # IB Gateway login status
```

**Persisted log files** (enable bind-mount override in [CONTAINERIZATION.md](CONTAINERIZATION.md) for local file access):
```bash
tail -f docker/data/trade_log.txt    # CSP execution details and order fills
tail -f docker/data/wheel_log.txt    # Wheel check: stop loss exits, covered calls
tail -f docker/data/risk_log.txt     # Daily risk monitor and P&L snapshots
cat docker/data/state.json           # Full system state: positions, wheel holdings, P&L
```

## Screener Scoring

```
Score = 0.50 × buffer_pct × (1.5 if buffer ≥ 10%)
      + 0.35 × premium_pct × (1.1 if in buyzone)
      + 0.15 × (iv_atm / 10)
```

Hard filters applied before scoring:
- `wheel_fit == "Wheel-ready"`
- Delta ≤ 0.21
- Buffer ≥ 5%
- Days to expiry ≥ 3 (Mon→Fri = 3 UTC calendar days)

## Capital Allocation

| Parameter | Default |
|-----------|---------|
| Total fund budget | $250,000 |
| Target per position | $50,000 |
| Max per position | $70,000 |
| Max positions | 5 |

The last position absorbs remaining capital up to `MAX_PER_POSITION`.

## Settings Reference

All settings are managed from the dashboard **Settings** page and hot-reload on every API call — no restart required unless noted. They are stored in `settings.json` and fall back to `settings_default.json` for any missing keys.

### Fund Settings

| Setting | Default | Range | Description |
|---------|---------|-------|-------------|
| Initial Fund Budget | $250,000 | $10K – $2M | Starting capital for CSP deployment. When Compound Weekly is off, this is always the deployment base. |
| # Positions | 5 | 1 – 10 | Target number of CSP positions to fill each Monday. |
| Min Position | $10,000 | $5K – $100K | Minimum capital allocated to any single CSP position. |
| Max Position | $90,000 | $10K – $200K | Maximum capital for any single position. The last position absorbs remaining budget up to this cap. |
| Compound Weekly | On | On / Off | When on, uses IBKR net liquidation as the Monday deployment budget so the fund grows as premiums accumulate. Falls back to Initial Fund Budget if IBKR is unreachable. |

### Screener Filters

| Setting | Default | Range | Description |
|---------|---------|-------|-------------|
| Max Delta | 0.21 | 0.10 – 0.30 | Maximum absolute delta for CSPs sold. Higher = more aggressive strikes and more premium, but more assignment risk. |
| Min Buffer % | 5% | 3% – 20% | The strike must be at least this far below the current stock price. Higher = more downside cushion. |
| Earnings Filter | 7 days | 0 – 30 days | Skip tickers with earnings within this many days. Protects against earnings-driven gap moves. |
| Ignore Earnings Filter for Wheel CCs | Off | On / Off | When on, covered calls are still sold on held positions even during earnings weeks. Has no effect on new CSP entries. |
| Stop Loss on Wheel Holdings | Off | On / Off | When on, a holding is sold on Monday if its price has fallen more than the Stop Loss % below its assigned strike. The screener exit is the primary exit — this is an optional additional layer. |
| Stop Loss % | 10% | 0% – 50% | How far below the assigned strike triggers a stop loss sale. Only active when Stop Loss on Wheel Holdings is enabled. |

### Liquidity Filters

| Setting | Default | Range | Description |
|---------|---------|-------|-------------|
| Max Spread % | 20% | 5% – 50% | Skip a CSP if the bid/ask spread exceeds this percentage of the mid price. Protects against poor fills on illiquid options. |
| Min Bid Yield % | 1% | 0.5% – 3% | Override the spread filter if the bid yield meets this threshold — useful when wide spreads are justified by high premium. |
| Max Spread Hard Cap % | 50% | 25% – 100% | Always skip regardless of yield if spread exceeds this. An absolute ceiling that cannot be overridden by bid yield. |

### Execution

| Setting | Default | Options | Description |
|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
| Monday Execution Time | 10:00 AM PST | Any time | When the CSP pipeline fires each Monday. 10:00 AM PST (1:00 PM ET) is recommended for best liquidity and tighter spreads. **Requires a scheduler restart to take effect.** |
| Dry Run | Off | On / Off | Simulate all orders without placing real trades. Fills are logged as `dry_run`. Useful for testing a new configuration. When in live trading, enable this for extra protection before committing real money. |

## Order Execution

Each position escalates through three stages (120 seconds each):
1. **Limit @ mid** — tries for best price
2. **Limit @ bid** — accepts bid to ensure fill
3. **Market order** — last resort

Liquidity checks: spread ≤ 20%, open interest ≥ 100.

## 🔔 Optional: Discord Notifications

YRVI can post trade results to a Discord channel automatically. This is entirely optional — if no webhook is configured, the system runs silently as normal.

### What gets posted

| Event | When | Content |
|-------|------|---------|
| Pre-execution preview | Monday 9:50AM | Sized positions with strikes, contracts, estimated premium |
| Weekly results | Monday ~10:30AM | CSP/CC/stop-loss P&L, week yield %, YTD stats |
| Assignment alert | Friday 4:15PM | Newly assigned stocks with stop-loss prices |

Results are color-coded: 🟢 green (≥1% yield), 🟡 yellow (0.5–1%), 🔴 red (<0.5%).

YTD stats track total premium collected, weeks traded, avg weekly yield, best/worst week, and progress toward the $100K annual target. Stored locally in `ytd_tracker.json`.

### Setup

1. In Discord, go to your channel → **Edit Channel → Integrations → Webhooks → New Webhook**
2. Copy the webhook URL
3. Add it to your `.env` file:
   ```env
   DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/xxx/yyy
   ```
4. Restart the scheduler — Discord posts will begin automatically

No code changes needed. If `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` is absent or blank, all Discord calls are silently skipped.

## Legacy / Manual Setup (macOS launchd)

> **DEPRECATED — for historical reference only.** This pre-Docker launchd setup is no longer supported. Use the Docker setup above. Credentials in this section reference the old `.env` / Keychain approach, which was replaced by the secrets container in v1.3.0.

**Prerequisites (legacy):** Python 3.13+, macOS Sequoia, IB Gateway.

**One-time setup:**
```bash
cp .env.template .env     # fill in IBKR credentials and RENDER_SECRET
bash setup_ibc.sh
```

`setup_ibc.sh` installs Homebrew, Python 3.13, IB Gateway, IBC, and the launchd scheduler service.

**IB Gateway service management:**
```bash
launchctl list com.yourockfund.ibgateway
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u) com.yourockfund.ibgateway
tail -f ~/IBC/Logs/ibgateway_stdout.log
```

**Scheduler management:**
```bash
launchctl list com.yourockfund.scheduler
launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.yourockfund.scheduler.plist
launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.yourockfund.scheduler.plist
tail -f ~/you_rock_fund/scheduler_stdout.log
```

**Monitoring (legacy):**
```bash
tail -f trade_log.txt        # CSP execution details
tail -f wheel_log.txt        # Wheel check and covered calls
tail -f risk_log.txt         # Daily risk monitor
cat state.json               # Full system state
```

## Version History

### v1.19.0 (May 2026)
- **Compound Weekly** — when enabled (default on), the Monday pipeline uses IBKR net liquidation as the deployment budget so the fund grows automatically as premiums accumulate; falls back to Initial Fund Budget if IBKR is unreachable
- **Stop Loss on Wheel Holdings** — optional toggle to sell a holding on Monday if price falls more than a configurable % below its assigned strike (0–50%, default 10%); off by default since the screener exit is the primary exit
- **Dry Run default changed to off** — paper trading is already the safety layer; Dry Run on first install no longer adds a redundant extra step. Live trading mode shows an amber callout in Settings so users know the option exists
- **Settings Reference** — collapsible reference section added to the Help page (grouped by section, with default and range for every setting); matching table added to README
- Version files reconciled: `VERSION`, `package.json`, and README badge now all track the same number

### v1.6.0 (May 2026)
- Version update notification — dashboard checks GitHub for a newer release and displays a banner with a one-click `yrvi://` upgrade link
- `yrvi://` URL scheme registered by `setup_docker.sh` so upgrade links open Terminal and run the upgrade script automatically
- Wheel manager prefers the assigned-strike CC when the highest available delta is ≥ 0.20, rather than always picking the strike closest to 0.20
- This Week page shows a screener estimates disclaimer so members understand data is pre-market and may change
- Bug fixes: generic tick list for option greeks, CC positions no longer consume CSP slots, held tickers always included in screener targets, secrets client used for Discord webhook URLs

### v1.5.0 (May 2026)
- Dashboard IBKR Holdings table now shows Delta, Buffer %, Prem/Contract, and Total Premium for each option position
- `trade_log.json` written to the `yrvi_data` volume at fill time for every CSP and CC order, capturing delta, buffer %, and premium at entry
- `/api/positions` joins live IBKR portfolio items with `trade_log.json` on `(symbol, expiry, strike, right)`; missing fields return null and display as `—`
- One-time backfill reconstructs current-week CSP records from `state.json` on first run (only where fill price is confirmed — no guessing)

### v1.4.5 (May 2026)
- Shutdown button on Settings page with confirmation dialog — stops all YRVI containers (scheduler, web, ib_gateway, secrets, api) in order, api last
- `POST /api/shutdown` accepts `{"confirm": "shutdown"}` and runs `docker stop` against each container
- `POST /api/restart-scheduler` now works in Docker mode (was returning HTTP 501) — runs `docker restart yrvi-scheduler-1`
- `Dockerfile.api` installs the static Docker CLI (~70MB) from download.docker.com (arch-aware: x86_64 / aarch64)
- `docker-compose.yml` mounts `/var/run/docker.sock` into the api container with `:ro` (note: read-only does not restrict Docker API commands — the api effectively has root on the host)

### v1.4.4 (May 2026)
- Timezone dropdown on Settings page (6 US timezones — Pacific, Mountain, Central, Eastern, Alaska, Hawaii)
- `POST /api/settings/timezone` validates the IANA name via `zoneinfo.ZoneInfo` and persists to `settings.json`
- Scheduler reads `timezone` from `settings.json` at startup (falls back to `TIME_ZONE` env var, then `America/Los_Angeles`)
- Closes #3

### v1.4.3 (May 2026)
- `tws_password_live` moved to optional — paper-only members no longer blocked at setup
- Secrets page `Required` section now lists 4 keys (was 5); `tws_password_live` moves to `Optional`

### v1.4.2 (May 2026)
- Secrets page now dynamically renders all secrets from the API (was hardcoded to 5, now shows all 10)
- New Account Info section showing IBKR account ID and username fields
- Unknown future secrets surfaced from the backend automatically render with their raw key as the label (no frontend change needed)

### v1.4.1 (May 2026)
- IB Gateway: stop retrying login on failure to prevent IBKR account lockout (`LoginFailed=terminate` patched into IBC config at startup)
- IB Gateway: credential preflight check before IBC starts — exits cleanly with Discord alert if `tws_userid_*` or `tws_password_*` is missing from the secrets container
- IB Gateway: lockout dialog detection (case-insensitive match on "locked out", "excessive number of failed login attempts", "PASSWORD NOTICE", "Login failed") sends a Discord alert and halts the container
- IB Gateway entrypoint now wraps the gateway process in a monitored runner instead of `exec` so log patterns can be observed

### v1.4.0 (May 2026)
- Account credentials moved into the secrets container UI — IBKR account ID, IBKR username, and VNC password are now entered once at `http://localhost:8001` instead of by editing `.env.compose`
- `account_paper`, `tws_userid_paper`, `account_live`, `tws_userid_live`, `vnc_server_password` added to the secrets store (AES-256-GCM)
- `setup.html` reorganized: new "Account Info" section above the existing passwords section
- IB Gateway entrypoint fetches `TWS_USERID` + `VNC_SERVER_PASSWORD` from the secrets container at startup (falls back to `ibgateway123!test` for VNC when unset)
- `config.py` reads `ACCOUNT` via `secrets_client.get_secret`, keyed by `TRADING_MODE`
- Removed `ACCOUNT_PAPER`, `TWS_USERID_PAPER`, `ACCOUNT_LIVE`, `TWS_USERID_LIVE`, `VNC_SERVER_PASSWORD`, `IBKR_USERNAME_LIVE`, `IBKR_PASSWORD_LIVE_FILE` from `.env.compose`
- Closes #1

### v1.3.1 (May 2026)
- README fully updated for v1.3.0 secrets container architecture (removed all stale macOS Keychain references from setup, security, and script-flow sections)
- `docker/preflight.sh` orphan `secrets_dir` variable removed

### v1.3.0 (May 2026)
- Secrets container — encrypted secrets manager, removes macOS Keychain dependency, cross-platform support

### v1.2.0 (May 2026)
- Watchdog auto-restart: after 30 min down outside market hours, watchdog restarts ib_gateway via `yrvi-restart.sh` and sends Discord alerts before/after
- New `auto_restart_gateway` setting (default true) — toggleable from dashboard
- Market-hours guard: no auto-restart 9:30 AM – 4:00 PM ET; alert-only during market hours
- One restart attempt per failure episode; resumes hourly alerts if restart fails

### v1.1.0-beta (April 2026)
- macOS Keychain secrets management (replaces manual docker/secrets/ file creation)
- setup_docker.sh --paper / --live mode flags (required, replaces bare invocation)
- Password double-entry confirmation with character count on first run
- Ephemeral secret files — written at launch, deleted after containers start
- Secret rotation via Keychain Access.app (delete entry, re-run script)
- Steps 5 & 6 idempotent — login item and Desktop app skip if already installed
- Hardware tier policy: Mac Mini required for live trading, Windows scoped to paper only
- README: Hardware Requirements table, Security section, You Rock Club onboarding note
- Versioning policy: minor bump for new capabilities, patch for field fixes, beta drops when first live Mac Mini member completes a full week unassisted

### v1.0.0-beta (April 2026)
- Docker containerization (replaces launchd)
- Cross-platform: Mac Intel/ARM + Windows
- Secrets management via macOS Keychain (ephemeral docker/secrets/ files)
- Auto-start via Docker login plist
- nginx serving React dashboard
- Socket-based health checks
- Scheduler heartbeat monitoring

### v0.1.0-beta (April 2026)
- Initial automated trading system
- Wheel strategy (CSP + CC)
- IB Gateway auto-login via IBC
- Zero-touch Mac reboot via launchd
- Discord auto-posting
- Web dashboard (React + FastAPI)
- YRVI logo and desktop app
