## [3.0.0] — 2026-05-30
### Added
- **Live trading support** — YRVI now connects to real IBKR live accounts in addition to paper trading. Switch between modes from the Settings page with a single toggle.
- **Paper ↔ Live toggle** — Settings page toggle with CONFIRM dialog, masked account preview, and Discord alert on every mode switch. Gateway restarts automatically with the correct credentials for the selected mode.
- **Live credentials via secrets container** — `tws_userid_live`, `tws_password_live`, and `account_live` are stored in the encrypted secrets container alongside paper credentials. No `.env` file changes required.
- **Green live mode indicator** — header pill and Settings badge turn green + pulse when live trading is active. "Switch to Live" button remains red as a deliberate warning for the action.
- **Amber live mode warning bar** — Settings page shows "Live mode active — all trades use real money" in high-contrast amber (light and dark mode).
- **Reset Installation button always visible** — moved from diagnostics-only to a permanent button in Settings → IB Gateway section for easy access during recovery.
- **Account-scoped positions** — dashboard IBKR Holdings now filters by the configured account, preventing positions from other accounts under the same IBKR login from appearing.
- **Unrealized/Realized P&L display fix** — zero values now show as `+$0.00` instead of "Live account only."

### Requirements
- **IB Key required for live trading** — SMS 2FA is not supported for unattended automation. Enable IB Key (push notification) via the IBKR Mobile app before switching to live. First live login requires a one-time phone approval via VNC; nightly auto-restarts need fresh approval only once per week (Sunday session reset).

### Fixed
- **Live password read from secrets, not env var** — `IBKR_PASSWORD_LIVE` env var check replaced with `get_secret("tws_password_live")` for consistency with all other credentials.
- **Gateway restart uses docker, not launchctl** — `_restart_ibgateway()` now calls `docker restart ib_gateway` (works inside the API container) instead of `launchctl` (macOS host only).
- **Trading mode written to shared volume** — gateway entrypoint reads `/data/gw_trading_mode` override so the correct account credentials are fetched on restart without rebuilding the image.
- **IBKR port uses socat ports** — API connects on 4003 (live) and 4004 (paper) — the socat listener ports — not the raw Gateway ports 4001/4002.

## [2.2.28] — 2026-05-29
### Fixed
- **Startup script no longer reports a false NO-GO on cold start** — `startup.sh` was counting 4 container-not-found failures before running `setup_docker.sh`, then never subtracting them after setup succeeded. The script now re-checks each container after setup and flips fail→pass, then waits up to 60 s for the API to be ready before the health check runs. Result: a clean cold start now shows 15 passed / 0 failed / GO instead of 5 phantom failures.
- **Settings page "Reset to Defaults" now resets all fields** — several settings fields (e.g. Gateway restart time, suppress window) were not included in the reset payload, leaving stale values after a reset. All configurable settings are now covered.

## [2.2.27] — 2026-05-28
### Changed
- **Auto-update test bump** — version bump used to verify end-to-end auto-update flow.

## [2.2.26] — 2026-05-28
### Changed
- **Auto-update delegates git pull + rebuild to API** — scheduler-triggered auto-update now calls `POST /api/version/upgrade` instead of running git and Docker commands in-process, keeping the upgrade path consistent with the manual upgrade button.

## [2.2.25] — 2026-05-28
### Added
- **Scheduled auto-update (opt-in)** — new Settings toggle to automatically pull and rebuild the latest version on Wednesday–Friday at 3 AM; off by default. `auto_update_enabled` added to `settings_default.json`. Scheduler checks at startup and registers/removes the nightly job accordingly.

## [2.2.24] — 2026-05-28
### Fixed
- **Reset Installation no longer fails with volume-in-use error** — the API now stops dependent containers before removing volumes, then removes the gateway container last, preventing Docker "volume is in use" errors during a reset.

## [2.2.23] — 2026-05-28
### Changed
- **Version number appended to all Discord alerts** — every outgoing Discord notification (watchdog, trade, weekly summary) now includes the running version so it's easy to correlate alerts with releases in the log.

## [2.2.22] — 2026-05-28
### Fixed
- **Smarter watchdog Discord alerts for gateway failures** — watchdog now inspects the gateway container state before alerting; distinguishes between container-stopped vs. IBKR-connection-lost scenarios and sends appropriately worded messages for each.

## [2.2.21] — 2026-05-28
### Added
- **One-click Reset Installation** — new button in the System Diagnostics panel (Help page) that stops all containers, removes the `yrvi_data` volume, and re-runs setup; designed to recover from IB Gateway version-mismatch errors that require a clean reinstall of the gateway image.
- `POST /api/reset-installation` endpoint orchestrates the full teardown and delegates to `setup_docker.sh`.

## [2.2.20] — 2026-05-28
### Fixed
- **Diagnostics log snippet chevron defaults to closed** — the expandable log snippet in the Help → System Diagnostics section now starts collapsed so it doesn't push other content off-screen on load.

## [2.2.19] — 2026-05-28
### Fixed
- **Gateway logs always shown in diagnostics** — the `GET /api/diag` endpoint now always fetches the last 30 lines of the gateway container log, regardless of whether the gateway appears healthy, so login errors and version-mismatch messages are visible in the Help page even when the container is running.

## [2.2.18] — 2026-05-28
### Changed
- **Auto-expand log snippet when present** — if `GET /api/diag` returns a gateway log snippet, the Help page now expands the log accordion automatically so members see the relevant lines immediately without an extra click.

## [2.2.17] — 2026-05-28
### Fixed
- **Detect IBC's actual bad-password dialog string** — gateway entrypoint log scan now matches the exact string IBC emits for a wrong password (`"Invalid password"`) in addition to the previously detected lockout strings, so password errors are caught before a lockout occurs.

## [2.2.16] — 2026-05-28
### Fixed
- **IB Gateway check gracefully handles ib_insync connect failures** — `GET /api/diag` now catches `ConnectionRefusedError` and similar exceptions when probing the IBKR API port and downgrades the result to a warning rather than a 500 error, so diagnostics still return usable status when the gateway is mid-restart.

## [2.2.15] — 2026-05-28
### Added
- **Richer IB Gateway diagnostics** — `GET /api/diag` now returns `gateway_container_state` (running/exited/missing), `gateway_log_snippet` (last 30 log lines), and `ibkr_login_status` (connected/login_failed/no_data). Help page renders these with color-coded badges and an expandable log panel.

## [2.2.14] — 2026-05-27
### Fixed
- **Upgrade endpoint resets tracked files before git pull** — `POST /api/version/upgrade` now runs `git checkout -- .` before pulling so stale local modifications to `VERSION` or other tracked files never cause the pull to abort with "local changes would be overwritten".

## [2.2.13] — 2026-05-27
### Fixed
- Version bump (no functional change — internal release tracking).

## [2.2.12] — 2026-05-27
### Fixed
- Version bump (no functional change — internal release tracking).

## [2.2.11] — 2026-05-27
### Fixed
- Version bump (no functional change — internal release tracking).

## [2.2.10] — 2026-05-27
### Added
- **Windows setup guide** — [WINDOWS_SETUP.md](./WINDOWS_SETUP.md) added for GEEKOM A5 and equivalent Windows Mini PCs; covers Git Bash, Docker Desktop, auto-login, Remote Desktop, and full live trading setup.
- `setup_windows.ps1` deprecated — `setup_docker.sh` is now the single setup entry point for macOS and Windows.
- Windows Mini PC added to the live trading hardware table in README; "Windows paper-only" restriction removed.

## [2.2.9] — 2026-05-26
### Fixed
- **Open position cards now show a true execution-time snapshot** — Price, Buffer, Delta, and Yield all reflect the exact state when the option was sold, not Saturday's screener snapshot.
  - `trader.py` fetches the live underlying stock price from IBKR immediately after a fill via new `_get_stock_price()` and stores it as `stock_price_at_entry` in both `state.json` executions and `trade_log.json`. `buffer_pct_at_entry` is now computed from this live price (was previously using the screener's Saturday price).
  - `api.py` joins `trade_log.json` once and surfaces `stock_price_at_entry` and `buffer_pct_at_entry` into the `/api/positions` response (previously these were only used for the IBKR Holdings table).
  - `PositionCard.jsx` prefers execution-time values (`stock_price_at_entry`, `buffer_pct_at_entry`) over screener values (`latest_price`, `buffer_pct`), with graceful fallback to screener data for positions from before this release.

## [2.2.8] — 2026-05-26
### Fixed
- **Open positions card shows actual fill yield, not screener yield** — "Yield" on the Dashboard position card was displaying the screener's projected yield (e.g., 2.21% for BE) rather than the actual collected yield at fill (e.g., 0.89%). The API now computes `fill_yield_pct = fill_price / strike × 100` from the execution record. The card label changes from "Yield" to "Act. Yield" for filled positions to make the distinction explicit. Unfilled/skipped positions still show screener yield.
- **Position card "Delta" now shows entry-time Greek delta** — the stats grid previously showed the screener's planned delta (`pos["delta"]`). It now prefers `delta_at_entry` (the IBKR-measured delta at execution time) from the enriched execution record, falling back to the screener delta when not available. Column renamed "Entry δ" to match the dashboard IBKR Holdings table.
- **`delta_at_entry` included in API `/api/positions` response** — was previously only written to `trade_log.json`; now also surfaced in the enriched execution data returned by the positions endpoint.

## [2.2.7] — 2026-05-26
### Fixed
- **Strike upward adjustment when stock rallies** — `verify_and_adjust_strike` now handles both directions. Previously it only scanned *downward* when a stock fell and delta exceeded the 0.21 ceiling. If a stock rallied between Saturday and Monday (as with BE this week), the screener strike's delta could drop far below target (e.g., 0.13) and the system would execute there anyway. Now a `MIN_DELTA = 0.15` floor triggers an upward scan: the system walks up the option chain to find the highest strike still within the 0.21 cap, maximising premium while staying within risk limits.

### Added
- **Delta shown in Discord execution results** — each filled trade now displays the screener (planned) delta alongside the execution delta in `δplan→actual` format (e.g., `δ0.20→0.13`). Makes it easy to spot drift between Saturday screener and Monday open. The `delta_at_entry` field is now written into `state.json` executions (it was previously only in `trade_log.json`).

### Changed
- **Dashboard "Delta" column renamed to "Entry δ"** — clarifies that the value shown is the Greek delta of the option at entry time, not a plan-vs-actual price difference.

## [1.23.0] — 2026-05-24
### Changed
- **Apply to Gateway now restarts the container immediately** — writes the new restart time to a shared volume file (`/data/gw_auto_restart_time`), then issues `docker restart ib_gateway`; gateway entrypoint reads the override on every startup so the change persists across future restarts without editing `.env.compose`
- Gateway entrypoint (`docker/ib-gateway/entrypoint.sh`) reads `/data/gw_auto_restart_time` override before starting IBC, exporting it as `AUTO_RESTART_TIME`
- `yrvi_data` volume now mounted into `ib_gateway` container at `/data` so the override file is accessible to the entrypoint
- Apply to Gateway returns immediately (restart runs in background thread, ~30–60s); success message updated to reflect that the gateway is restarting

## [1.22.0] — 2026-05-24
### Added
- **IB Gateway settings UI** — new Settings section with a daily auto-restart time picker (7 PM – 2 AM), a restart window slider (10–60 min), and an "Apply to Gateway" button that patches IBC `config.ini` in the running container via `docker exec`
- `POST /api/gateway/patch-restart-time` — patches `AutoRestartTime` in IBC `config.ini` inside the running gateway container
- `auto_restart_time` and `auto_restart_suppress_mins` added to `settings.json` schema and `SettingsUpdate` model; settings take effect on the next watchdog poll with no container restart
- `AUTO_RESTART_TIME` and `AUTO_RESTART_SUPPRESS_SECS` added to `x-python-env` anchor in `docker-compose.yml` so the api container inherits them alongside the gateway

### Fixed
- **Watchdog alert messages are now context-aware** — failures within the configured restart window say "likely the daily restart — a ✅ recovery message will follow" instead of "manual restart required"; failures outside the window keep the original urgent wording
- Removed "2FA or confirmation dialog" assumption from IBKR connection-failure alerts — paper accounts have no 2FA; message now says "slow to reconnect or stuck on a login dialog"
- **Recovery messages now paired with alerts** — `✅ restored` only fires if a prior `🚨` alert was sent for that episode; eliminates phantom recovery messages when the restart window suppresses the outgoing alert

## [1.18.0] — 2026-05-20
### Fixed
- Upgrade reconnect polling timeout increased from 15s to 120s — Docker image builds take 1-2 minutes before containers restart; 15s was triggering a false "Upgrade problem" error while the build was still running
- Upgrade modal phase labels updated to set clearer expectations ("Building & restarting — this takes 1–2 minutes…")

## [1.17.0] — 2026-05-20
### Fixed
- Version badge click now shows feedback in all cases: "✓ Up to date" (green) when current, "Unable to reach GitHub" (gray) if the check fails — previously silent on both

## [1.16.0] — 2026-05-20
### Added
- Clicking the version badge when already up to date briefly flashes "✓ Up to date" in green for 2 seconds — confirms the check ran

## [1.15.0] — 2026-05-20
### Added
- Version badge in status bar is now clickable — click to immediately check for updates; shows a spinner while checking and reveals the Upgrade button if a new version is found

## [1.14.0] — 2026-05-20
### Fixed
- Feedback sender lookup now uses correct secret key `tws_userid_paper` (was `tws_userid`); falls back to `tws_userid_live` then `account_paper` — eliminates "root" showing up from Docker home directory

## [1.13.0] — 2026-05-20
### Changed
- Feedback Discord post now identifies the sender: IBKR username (`tws_userid`) → live username (`tws_userid_live`) → home directory name → "Unknown"

## [1.12.0] — 2026-05-20
### Changed
- Feedback webhook ships with a hardcoded default (`#yrvi-app-feedback`) — works out of the box with no manual secret setup; overridable via `discord_feedback_webhook_url` secret

## [1.11.0] — 2026-05-20
### Added
- Help page feedback form — Bug Report / Feature Request selector + textarea posts directly to `#yrvi-app-feedback` Discord channel via `/api/feedback`; no Discord account needed, never leaves the dashboard
- `/api/feedback` endpoint reads `discord_feedback_webhook_url` secret and posts formatted message with version, mode, and timestamp
- `FeedbackRequest` Pydantic model

## [1.10.0] — 2026-05-20
### Added
- Help page (sidebar, pinned below a divider) with three sections: System Diagnostics, FAQ & Troubleshooting, Report a Bug / Feature Request
- `/api/diag` endpoint — fast read-only health check (scheduler heartbeat age, IB Gateway TCP reachability, last CSP run, last wheel check, market status today, version); no IBKR API calls
- `_next_execution()` in `api.py` now accounts for market holidays — status bar shows Tuesday when Monday is a holiday

## [1.9.0] — 2026-05-20
### Added
- `market_calendar.py` — NYSE holiday calendar computed dynamically from rules (no external dependencies); covers all 10 federal/NYSE holidays including Saturday/Sunday observation shifts
- Scheduler now skips all Monday trading jobs (wheel check, CSP pipeline, Discord preview) on market holidays and automatically shifts execution to Tuesday — handles Memorial Day, Labor Day, MLK Day, Presidents' Day, etc.
- Friday assignment detection skips on Good Friday; daily risk monitor skips on any market holiday (e.g. Thanksgiving Thursday)
- Startup log updated to reflect Mon/Tue firing window with holiday-shift note

## [1.6.0] — 2026-05-17
### Added
- Wheel holdings with active stock positions now appear as covered call (CC) entries in the weekly plan — screener switches from CSP to CC for held tickers, using `call_20d_strike` / `call_20d_premium` from the Render API
- Render API (`/api/targets/csp`) now returns `call_20d_strike`, `call_20d_premium`, `call_20d_premium_pct`, `call_20d_delta`, `call_20d_iv` for every ticker (data was in `iv_summary` but not selected)
- `get_top_targets()` accepts `always_include` set — held tickers are guaranteed in the screener results even if they score below the top-N cutoff
- This Week page shows INTC-style CC rows with $0 capital, contracts fixed by shares held, and CC strike/premium
### Fixed
- Weekly plan position sizer now sizes the top (remainder) position first, iterating past ineligible tickers like SNDK (too expensive per contract), so the best viable target (e.g. BE) gets the max allocation instead of a normal-sized slot
- CC positions no longer consume CSP slot count — `num_positions` for CSP sizing is no longer reduced by active wheel holding count; budget deduction already handles the capital constraint
- `discord_poster.py` webhook URLs now read via `secrets_client.get_secret()` instead of `/run/secrets/` file mounts, which no longer exist after the compose cleanup in v1.5.0
- `docker-compose.yml` file-based Docker secret declarations removed — all secrets served by the `yrvi-secrets` HTTP service; eliminates bind-mount errors on hosts without local secret files
- `held_map` definition moved before `get_top_targets()` call in `api.py` (was referenced before assignment, causing `NameError` on This Week screener runs)
- Stale `targets` variable reference in `api.py` screener return renamed to `all_targets`

## [1.5.0] — 2026-05-15
### Added
- feat: enrich IBKR Holdings table with execution metadata (delta, buffer %, premium/contract, total premium)
- feat: capture trade_log.json at fill time for CSPs and CCs
- feat: backfill current positions from state.json where recoverable
- feat: /api/positions enriched with trade_log join

## [1.4.5] — 2026-05-11
### Added
- Shutdown button on Settings page with confirmation dialog
- `POST /api/shutdown` stops all YRVI containers (scheduler, web, ib_gateway, secrets, api last)
### Fixed
- Restart Scheduler now works in Docker mode (docker.sock mount)
- `POST /api/restart-scheduler` no longer returns HTTP 501 — runs `docker restart yrvi-scheduler-1`
### Changed
- `Dockerfile.api` installs static Docker CLI from download.docker.com (arch-aware, ~70MB)
- `docker-compose.yml` api service mounts `/var/run/docker.sock:ro` (note: read-only flag doesn't restrict Docker API commands)

## [1.4.4] — 2026-05-11
### Added
- Timezone dropdown on Settings page (6 US timezones)
- POST /api/settings/timezone validates the IANA name and persists to settings.json
- Scheduler reads timezone from settings.json at startup (falls back to TIME_ZONE env, then America/Los_Angeles)
- Closes #3

## [1.4.3] — 2026-05-11
### Changed
- tws_password_live moved to optional — paper-only members no longer blocked at setup

## [1.4.2] — 2026-05-11
### Fixed
- Secrets page now dynamically renders all secrets from API (was hardcoded to 5, now shows all 10)
- New Account Info section showing IBKR account ID and username fields

## [1.4.1] — 2026-05-11
### Fixed
- IB Gateway: stop retrying login on failure to prevent IBKR account lockout (`LoginFailed=terminate` patched into IBC config at startup, searches common paths and logs which one was patched)
- IB Gateway: credential preflight check before IBC starts — exits cleanly with a Discord alert if `tws_userid_*` or `tws_password_*` is missing from the secrets container
- IB Gateway: lockout dialog detection — case-insensitive match on "locked out", "excessive number of failed login attempts", "PASSWORD NOTICE", "Login failed"; sends Discord alert and halts container on any match
- IB Gateway entrypoint wraps the gateway in a monitored runner (instead of `exec`) so log lines can be observed; the gateway's own exit code is still propagated
- Note: docker-compose.yml `restart: "no"` (set in v1.3.x) retained — most defensive against lockout

## [1.4.0] — 2026-05-11
### Added
- Account credentials managed via secrets container UI at `http://localhost:8001` — IBKR account ID, IBKR username, and VNC password no longer require `.env.compose` edits
- New secret keys: `account_paper`, `tws_userid_paper` (required); `account_live`, `tws_userid_live`, `vnc_server_password` (optional)
- `setup.html`: new "Account Info" section above the existing passwords section, with helpful labels and hint text for each field
- `setup_docker.sh` CLI fallback now prompts for the 5 new secrets when the browser flow times out
- IB Gateway `entrypoint.sh` fetches `TWS_USERID`, `TWS_PASSWORD`, and `VNC_SERVER_PASSWORD` from the secrets container at startup; VNC falls back to `ibgateway123!test` when unset
### Changed
- `config.py`: `ACCOUNT` is now resolved via `secrets_client.get_secret` keyed by `TRADING_MODE` (paper vs live), with `ACCOUNT` env var as a fallback
- `api.py` `_live_ready()` checks live credentials via secrets container instead of env vars
- `docker-compose.yml`: removed the `:?` hard-fail injections for `ACCOUNT_PAPER` / `TWS_USERID_PAPER` and the `ACCOUNT_LIVE` / `IBKR_USERNAME_LIVE` env passthroughs for api/scheduler
- `docker/preflight.sh`: validates required secrets via the secrets-container `/secrets/status` endpoint and cross-checks that `account_paper` ≠ `tws_userid_paper`
### Removed
- `.env.compose` no longer carries `ACCOUNT_PAPER`, `TWS_USERID_PAPER`, `ACCOUNT_LIVE`, `TWS_USERID_LIVE`, `VNC_SERVER_PASSWORD`, `IBKR_USERNAME_LIVE`, `IBKR_PASSWORD_LIVE_FILE`
- Closes #1

## [1.3.1] — 2026-05-06
### Fixed
- README fully updated for v1.3.0 secrets container architecture
- Removed all stale macOS Keychain references from setup, security, and script-flow sections (11 references updated)
- docker/preflight.sh orphan secrets_dir variable removed

## [1.3.0] — 2026-05-06
### Added
- secrets container: AES-256-GCM encrypted secrets store (docker/secrets_service/)
- secrets_client.py: 3-tier secret resolution (secrets container → /run/secrets/ file → env var)
- SecretsPage in dashboard: manage all credentials via UI with status indicators and inline editing
- setup_docker.sh: browser-first secrets entry with CLI fallback, removes macOS Keychain dependency
- yrvi-restart.sh: verifies secrets container instead of re-injecting from Keychain
### Changed
- docker-compose.yml: added secrets service, updated depends_on for api/scheduler/ib_gateway
- api.py: /api/secrets/* proxy endpoints, secrets read via secrets_client
- scheduler.py: discord webhook read via secrets_client
### Removed
- macOS Keychain dependency — stack now works on Mac, Windows, and Linux
- --keep-secrets flag from setup_docker.sh and yrvi-restart.sh
- Plaintext secret file injection on restart

## [1.2.6] - May 2026
### Added
- Discord weekly results: footnotes explaining skip reasons appear at the bottom of the trades field when applicable — "Spread too wide" (liquidity check) and "Contract too large" ($70K max per position) only included if that skip occurred that week
- `trader.py` now records `skipped_contract_size` in execution results when a fallback candidate's single contract would exceed the $70,000 max position size
### Fixed
- "Failed Market Data" badge on This Week page — verified already resolved; `ThisWeek.jsx` was rewritten to a table/screener view and no longer makes live IBKR market data requests

## [1.2.5] - May 2026
### Added
- Performance page: "Total Realized" stat card showing combined option premium + forced-sale P&L
- Performance table: separate "Premium" and "Sales P&L" columns; footer shows net effect of forced sales
- Bar chart tooltip shows sales P&L alongside premium when a forced liquidation occurred that week
### Changed
- `ytd_tracker.json` now stores `premium_collected`, `shares_sold_pnl`, and `total_realized` per week (backwards-compatible: old entries with `realized` are normalized on read)
- YTD `total_premium`, weekly `yield_pct`, and annual goal progress track option premium only — forced liquidations no longer inflate these numbers
- Sidebar version label removed — status bar version pill is the single source of truth
### Fixed
- `yrvi-build.sh`: re-queries container ID after `docker compose up --build` so health polling in Step 4 inspects the live container instead of the pre-rebuild (stale) ID

## [1.2.1] - May 2026
### Added
- Discord `🚨🚨🚨 EMERGENCY SHARE SALE` alert fires immediately on every wheel share sale (dropped screener, earnings this week, no viable CC), with ticker, shares, fill price, proceeds, reason, and realized P&L
- `_find_cc_strike()` fetches live IBKR market price before building the strike candidate list; scan floor = max(assigned_strike, current_price × 0.95) to avoid scanning deep-ITM calls when a stock has run up
- `detect_assignments()` falls back to IBKR `avgCost` when `assigned_strike` is missing from state, eliminating 0.00 placeholders
- Same avgCost fallback applied in `run_wheel_check()` Step 0 for untracked stocks detected at Monday open

## [1.2.0] - May 2026
### Added
- scripts/yrvi-restart.sh: re-injects Keychain secrets before docker restart, fixing individual container restarts
- Watchdog auto-restarts ib_gateway after 30 min down outside market hours (never during 9:30–4:00 PM ET)
- auto_restart_gateway setting with dashboard toggle (default true)
### Changed
- Watchdog alerts distinguish auto-restart attempted vs manual intervention required
