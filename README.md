# You Rock Volatility Income Fund (YRVI)

![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.3.0--beta-blue)

An automated Python algorithmic options trading system that generates weekly income through the complete wheel strategy — selling cash-secured puts (CSPs), managing assignments with covered calls (CCs), and enforcing automatic stop losses — all running 24/7 on a Mac Mini with zero manual intervention.

## How It Works

**Full weekly schedule:**

| Day | Time (PST) | Action |
|-----|-----------|--------|
| Saturday | 6:00 PM | Screener preview — logs top 5 targets, no trades |
| Monday | 9:50 AM | Discord preview — posts this week's sized positions |
| Monday | 9:55 AM | Wheel check — stop losses + sell covered calls on assigned stocks |
| Monday | 10:00 AM | CSP execution — screen → size → execute 5 positions |
| Tuesday–Thursday | 9:00 AM | Daily risk monitor — checks stop loss thresholds, logs P&L |
| Friday | 4:15 PM | Assignment detection — checks for newly assigned positions |

**Pipeline:**

1. **Screener** — fetches candidates from the Render API, applies hard filters (delta ≤ 0.21, buffer ≥ 5%, DTE ≥ 3), and scores survivors by buffer + premium + IV

2. **Position Sizer** — allocates $250K across up to 5 positions (~$50K each, last position gets remainder up to $70K max)

3. **Wheel Manager** — Monday 9:55 AM (four-step logic per holding):
   - **Step 1 — Screener check:** if ticker no longer passes screener filters → sell shares at market and free capital
   - **Step 2 — Option chain:** query IBKR for CALL options on the nearest Friday, strike ≥ assigned strike; collect delta for each candidate
   - **Step 3 — Decision:** sell the highest-delta (≥ 0.20) covered call found. If no strike with delta ≥ 0.20 exists → sell shares at market
   - **Step 4 — Accounting:** freed capital (from any sales) returns to the CSP pool; sold tickers are skipped in that week's screener

4. **Trader** — connects to IBKR, qualifies contracts, checks liquidity (spread ≤ 20%, OI ≥ 100), executes with limit-mid → limit-bid → market escalation; automatically replaces failed positions with the next ranked ticker

5. **Risk Manager** — daily Tue–Thu monitor checks all wheel holdings against the 10% stop loss threshold, logs unrealized P&L, and sends alerts

6. **Discord Poster** — (optional) posts weekly results, YTD stats, Monday previews, and Friday assignment alerts to a Discord channel automatically

## Strategy Overview

### The Wheel Strategy

```
Week 1:  Sell CSP on TICKER at $50 strike → collect $500 premium
           ↓ expires worthless → keep $500, repeat
           ↓ or assigned 100 shares at $50
Week 2:  Sell CC on 100 shares at $50 strike → collect $300 premium
           ↓ expires worthless → keep $300, repeat
           ↓ or shares called away at $50 → back to selling CSPs
```

Each cycle generates income whether the option expires or gets exercised.

### Risk Management

| Control | Rule |
|---------|------|
| Delta filter | Only sell puts with delta ≤ 0.21 (~20Δ) |
| Buffer requirement | Strike must be ≥ 5% below current price |
| Liquidity check | Spread ≤ 20%, Open Interest ≥ 100 |
| Screener exit | Sell shares if ticker drops from screener filters |
| Delta exit | Sell shares if no CC strike with delta ≥ 0.20 available |
| Earnings protection | Skip tickers with earnings within 7 days |
| Auto-replacement | Failed position → automatically try next ranked ticker |

## Getting Started

New to IBKR? See the **[IBKR Account Setup Guide](IBKR_SETUP_GUIDE.md)** for a complete walkthrough — from creating your account to paper trading your first week.

> **You Rock Club members:** If you intend to trade live on IBKR, you will need a Mac Mini (or any always-on Mac). Paper trading can be done on any Mac. Windows is supported for paper trading only.

> 📖 **You Rock Club Mac Mini Setup Guide:** See [MAC_MINI_SETUP.md](./MAC_MINI_SETUP.md) for a complete step-by-step walkthrough from unboxing to first trade.

> ❓ **Troubleshooting:** See [FAQ.md](./FAQ.md) for common setup issues and fixes.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (recommended for Mac) or [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io) (alternative)
- Access to the You Rock Club screener API (Render)

### Hardware Requirements

| Mode | Hardware | OS Required | Secrets Method |
|------|----------|-------------|----------------|
| Paper trading | Any Mac (Intel or Apple Silicon) | macOS | macOS Keychain |
| Live trading | Mac Mini (recommended) | macOS only | macOS Keychain |

> **Windows** is supported for development and paper trading only (see `setup_windows.ps1`). Live trading requires macOS due to Keychain integration.

### IB Gateway port reference

| Mode | Port (inside Docker network) |
|---|---|
| Paper trading | 4004 |
| Live trading | 4003 |

These are the ports the Python containers use to reach IB Gateway inside the Compose network. They differ from the standalone IB Gateway defaults (4002/4001) used in the legacy launchd setup.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/controllinghand/you_rock_fund.git you_rock_fund
cd you_rock_fund
```

#### Configure `.env.compose`

```bash
cp .env.compose.example .env.compose
nano .env.compose
```

Fill in these values for your account (everything else can stay as the default for paper trading):

| Variable | What to enter |
|---|---|
| `ACCOUNT_PAPER` | Your IBKR paper account ID (e.g. `DU1234567`) |
| `TWS_USERID_PAPER` | Your IBKR paper username |
| `ACCOUNT_LIVE` | Your IBKR live account ID |
| `TWS_USERID_LIVE` | Your IBKR live username |
| `IBKR_USERNAME_LIVE` | Same as `TWS_USERID_LIVE` |
| `VNC_SERVER_PASSWORD` | Set a VNC password (required for 2FA via IB Gateway) |

Leave `TRADING_MODE=paper` and `YRVI_INIT_DRY_RUN=true` — these are the safe defaults for a new setup.

Save and exit: `Ctrl+O` → `Enter` → `Ctrl+X`

#### Set Up Secret Files

Passwords and API keys are stored as individual files in `docker/secrets/`. The setup script handles IBKR and Render secrets automatically from macOS Keychain, but Discord webhooks must be created manually if you want notifications:

```bash
# Optional — leave out if you don't want Discord alerts
echo "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/xxx/yyy" > docker/secrets/discord_webhook_url
echo "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/xxx/yyy" > docker/secrets/discord_webhook_weekly_plan
```

See [`docker/secrets/README.md`](docker/secrets/README.md) for the full list of secret files and how to get each value.

> **Note:** The `docker/secrets/` directory is git-ignored except for `README.md`. All secret files you create there will never be committed.

#### Disable macOS Screen Sharing

IB Gateway uses port 5900 for VNC (required for 2FA). macOS Screen Sharing also uses port 5900 and will cause `docker compose up` to fail with a "address already in use" error.

Before running setup, go to **System Settings → General → Sharing → Screen Sharing → toggle OFF**.

> **Note:** Use SSH for remote terminal access to the Mac Mini instead — Screen Sharing cannot run alongside YRVI.

#### macOS Setup (Paper)

```bash
./setup_docker.sh --paper
```

On first run, you will be prompted for:
- Your IBKR paper account password (stored in macOS Keychain as `YRVI_TWS_PAPER`)
- Your Render API secret (stored in macOS Keychain as `YRVI_RENDER`)

On subsequent runs, secrets are pulled from Keychain silently — no re-entry needed.

#### macOS Setup (Live)

```bash
./setup_docker.sh --live
```

Requires a Mac Mini or equivalent always-on Mac. Live credentials are stored separately in Keychain (`YRVI_TWS_LIVE`) and never shared with paper mode.

#### Verifying Keychain storage

Open **Keychain Access.app** and search for `YRVI` to confirm your secrets are stored. You should see entries for `YRVI_TWS_PAPER` (or `YRVI_TWS_LIVE`) and `YRVI_RENDER`.

#### Rotating / updating a secret

If you need to update a stored secret (e.g. changed your IBKR password):
1. Open Keychain Access.app
2. Search for the entry (e.g. `YRVI_TWS_PAPER`)
3. Delete it
4. Re-run `./setup_docker.sh --paper` — you will be prompted for the new value

`setup_docker.sh` validates your config, builds all four containers (`ib_gateway`, `api`, `scheduler`, `web`), starts the stack, and installs a login item so containers restart automatically after a reboot.

See **[CONTAINERIZATION.md](CONTAINERIZATION.md)** for the full setup guide — credentials, 2FA recovery, and troubleshooting.

## Security

### Secret Security

- Secrets are stored in **macOS Keychain**, encrypted at rest and tied to your macOS login.
- Files in `docker/secrets/` are ephemeral — written at launch time and deleted automatically after containers start.
- `docker/secrets/` is in `.gitignore` and must never be committed.
- **Windows users (paper only):** secrets remain as files in `docker/secrets/` — treat them as sensitive and do not commit them.

## Mac Startup (after any reboot)

**Double-click `YRVI Startup` on your Desktop** to run the pre-flight check. It verifies the Docker containers are running and prints a full GO/NO-GO status table.

Or from the terminal:
```bash
bash ~/you_rock_fund/startup.sh
```

**Container management:**
```bash
# Status
docker compose --env-file .env.compose ps

# Logs
docker compose --env-file .env.compose logs -f scheduler
docker compose --env-file .env.compose logs -f ib_gateway

# Restart scheduler
docker compose --env-file .env.compose restart scheduler
```

### Restarting and Rebuilding Containers

Both scripts re-inject secrets from macOS Keychain before operating, fixing the bind-mount error that occurs when secret files have been wiped.

| Script | When to use |
|--------|-------------|
| `yrvi-restart.sh` | Restart existing container — same image, no rebuild (fast) |
| `yrvi-build.sh` | Rebuild image then restart — use after code changes |

**yrvi-restart.sh** — restart without rebuilding:
```bash
./scripts/yrvi-restart.sh ib_gateway --paper
./scripts/yrvi-restart.sh api        --paper
./scripts/yrvi-restart.sh scheduler  --paper
./scripts/yrvi-restart.sh ib_gateway --live   # requires YRVI_ENV=live in environment
```

Flags: `--dry-run`, `--keep-secrets`

**yrvi-build.sh** — rebuild image and restart:
```bash
./scripts/yrvi-build.sh api       --paper   # after editing api.py
./scripts/yrvi-build.sh scheduler --paper   # after editing scheduler.py
./scripts/yrvi-build.sh all       --paper   # rebuild full stack
```

Flags: `--dry-run`

**What both scripts do:**
1. Fetch secrets from macOS Keychain (`YRVI_TWS_PAPER` / `YRVI_TWS_LIVE` and `YRVI_RENDER`)
2. Write them to `docker/secrets/` (chmod 600)
3. `yrvi-restart.sh`: runs `docker restart <container>` — `yrvi-build.sh`: runs `docker compose up -d --build [container]`
4. Poll health status every 3s (`ib_gateway` timeout: 180s; others: 60s), then wipe secret files

## Running Manually

**Run full pipeline once immediately** (screener → size → execute):
```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.compose exec scheduler python - <<'PY'
import scheduler
scheduler.run_pipeline()
PY
```

**Manual wheel operations:**
```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.compose exec scheduler python wheel_manager.py detect
docker compose --env-file .env.compose exec scheduler python wheel_manager.py check
docker compose --env-file .env.compose exec scheduler python risk_manager.py
```

**Dry run** — set `dry_run: true` via the dashboard settings or the API:
```bash
curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/settings \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"dry_run":true}'
```

## Monitoring

**Live container logs:**
```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.compose logs -f scheduler   # execution, wheel, risk jobs
docker compose --env-file .env.compose logs -f api         # dashboard API requests
docker compose --env-file .env.compose logs -f ib_gateway  # IB Gateway login status
```

**Persisted log files** (enable bind-mount override in [CONTAINERIZATION.md](CONTAINERIZATION.md) for local file access):
```bash
tail -f docker/data/trade_log.txt    # CSP execution details and order fills
tail -f docker/data/wheel_log.txt    # Wheel check: stop loss exits, covered calls
tail -f docker/data/risk_log.txt     # Daily risk monitor and P&L snapshots
cat docker/data/state.json           # Full system state: positions, wheel holdings, P&L
```

## Screener Scoring

```
Score = 0.50 × buffer_pct × (1.5 if buffer ≥ 10%)
      + 0.35 × premium_pct × (1.1 if in buyzone)
      + 0.15 × (iv_atm / 10)
```

Hard filters applied before scoring:
- `wheel_fit == "Wheel-ready"`
- Delta ≤ 0.21
- Buffer ≥ 5%
- Days to expiry ≥ 3 (Mon→Fri = 3 UTC calendar days)

## Capital Allocation

| Parameter | Default |
|-----------|---------|
| Total fund budget | $250,000 |
| Target per position | $50,000 |
| Max per position | $70,000 |
| Max positions | 5 |

The last position absorbs remaining capital up to `MAX_PER_POSITION`.

## Order Execution

Each position escalates through three stages (120 seconds each):
1. **Limit @ mid** — tries for best price
2. **Limit @ bid** — accepts bid to ensure fill
3. **Market order** — last resort

Liquidity checks: spread ≤ 20%, open interest ≥ 100.

## 🔔 Optional: Discord Notifications

YRVI can post trade results to a Discord channel automatically. This is entirely optional — if no webhook is configured, the system runs silently as normal.

### What gets posted

| Event | When | Content |
|-------|------|---------|
| Pre-execution preview | Monday 9:50AM | Sized positions with strikes, contracts, estimated premium |
| Weekly results | Monday ~10:30AM | CSP/CC/stop-loss P&L, week yield %, YTD stats |
| Assignment alert | Friday 4:15PM | Newly assigned stocks with stop-loss prices |

Results are color-coded: 🟢 green (≥1% yield), 🟡 yellow (0.5–1%), 🔴 red (<0.5%).

YTD stats track total premium collected, weeks traded, avg weekly yield, best/worst week, and progress toward the $100K annual target. Stored locally in `ytd_tracker.json`.

### Setup

1. In Discord, go to your channel → **Edit Channel → Integrations → Webhooks → New Webhook**
2. Copy the webhook URL
3. Add it to your `.env` file:
   ```env
   DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/xxx/yyy
   ```
4. Restart the scheduler — Discord posts will begin automatically

No code changes needed. If `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` is absent or blank, all Discord calls are silently skipped.

## Legacy / Manual Setup (macOS launchd)

> The Docker setup above is the recommended install. This section documents the original macOS-only launchd approach for reference or if Docker is not available.

**Prerequisites (legacy):** Python 3.13+, macOS Sequoia, IB Gateway.

**One-time setup:**
```bash
cp .env.template .env     # fill in IBKR credentials and RENDER_SECRET
bash setup_ibc.sh
```

`setup_ibc.sh` installs Homebrew, Python 3.13, IB Gateway, IBC, and the launchd scheduler service.

**IB Gateway service management:**
```bash
launchctl list com.yourockfund.ibgateway
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u) com.yourockfund.ibgateway
tail -f ~/IBC/Logs/ibgateway_stdout.log
```

**Scheduler management:**
```bash
launchctl list com.yourockfund.scheduler
launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.yourockfund.scheduler.plist
launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.yourockfund.scheduler.plist
tail -f ~/you_rock_fund/scheduler_stdout.log
```

**Monitoring (legacy):**
```bash
tail -f trade_log.txt        # CSP execution details
tail -f wheel_log.txt        # Wheel check and covered calls
tail -f risk_log.txt         # Daily risk monitor
cat state.json               # Full system state
```
